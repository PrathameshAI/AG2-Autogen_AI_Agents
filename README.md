**#Overview**

AG2 is an autonomous AI agent system that leverages Conversable Agents to perform various interactive tasks such as generating structured responses, conducting multi-agent conversations, and executing collaborative workflows. The system is built using OpenAI's LLMs and AutoGen framework to create responsive and task-oriented agents.

#Features

1.Conversable Agents: Implements AI agents that interact in structured and creative ways.

2.Multi-Agent Collaboration: Agents communicate with each other to achieve specific tasks.

3.Structured Output Generation: Capable of returning JSON-formatted responses.

4.Customizable System Messages: Agents are tailored to different roles, such as poets, lesson planners, or comedians.

5.Automated Task Execution: Uses group chat managers to determine conversation flow and execution order.

6.LLM-Powered Reasoning: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model for intelligent responses.
